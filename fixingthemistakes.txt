FIXING THE MISTAKES
checkout
reset
revert
clean

What happens when you git checkout a branch?

    1. HEAD is moved to the branch
    2. Copy the commit snapshot to the staging area
    3. Update the working are with the branch contents

for overwrinting a particular file , we use git checkout -- filename
 it will replace the working area with the version from the current staging area
